Whether you are aiming to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply maintain a healthy lifestyle, FITX’s nutrition plans can be tailored to meet your individual needs. Here's how the app supports users in their nutrition journey:

           <p>
            1. Personalized Calorie Tracking
            
            
             FITX allows users to set their calorie goals based on their fitness objectives. Whether you're looking to build muscle, lose fat, or simply maintain weight, the app calculates the number of calories you need each day. It takes into account factors like:
            
                Age
                Gender
                Weight

            </p>
            <p>
            2. Custom Macronutrient Ratios
            
            The app provides tailored macronutrient breakdowns (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) to help you achieve your fitness goals. It uses scientific principles to optimize the distribution of macronutrients based on:
            
                Weight loss: Higher protein, moderate carbs, lower fat
                Muscle gain: Higher protein, higher carbs, moderate fat
                Maintenance: Balanced protein, carbs, and fats</p>
            
            <p>
            3. Meal Planning and Recommendations
            
            Based on your daily calorie intake and macronutrient needs, FITX suggests meals that fit within your personalized plan. It offers:
            
                Healthy, nutrient-dense meal options
                Recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks
                Variety to suit different dietary preferences (e.g., vegan, keto, paleo)
            
            Example: If you're on a high-protein diet, the app will suggest meals like grilled chicken with quinoa or a protein smoothie.</p>

            <p>
            4. Food Database

            <p>5. Integration with Exercise and Activity Tracking
            
            FITX's nutrition plans are not isolated from your exercise routines. The app syncs with fitness trackers and logs your activity, adjusting your caloric intake based on the energy you’ve expended. This helps you stay on track with your goals and ensures that your nutrition plan aligns with your workout efforts.</p>
            <p>6. Hydration Tracking

The app will remind you to drink water and help you stay on top of your hydration needs based on your activity level and environmental factors.
            <p>7. Progress Monitoring
            
            FITX allows users to track their progress over time. It:
            
                Monitors weight, body measurements, and body fat percentage
                Tracks the calories consumed vs. burned
                Shows trends and patterns that help you understand how your nutrition plan is affecting your progress
            
            With this data, users can fine-tune their nutrition plans and make adjustments as necessary. </p>
            <p>8. Expert Advice and Support
                For users who need extra guidance, FITX offers in-app consultations with nutritionists or access to personalized coaching. This ensures that users receive expert advice tailored to their unique needs and goals.
            </p>
            <p>9. Shopping Lists
            
            Based on your meal plans, the app can generate shopping lists to make grocery shopping more efficient. The lists are organized by categories (e.g., vegetables, dairy, proteins) to streamline the process, ensuring you have everything you need for your meals.
            </p>
            <p>
